Subtle hints of oak, vanilla, and a touch of spice add complexity. It offers a medium to full-bodied experience with a smooth, approachable mouthfeel.",

    "Wine Description": "Celebrated by the Vivino community as ‘bold yet smooth; rich and complex’, ‘very well balanced’ and ‘wonderful on the first sip’, this Caymus Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon demands attention. The vibrant, oaky and earthy Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, with subtle black fruit undertones, is reassuringly bold and velvety, and for this reason, has earned its place as one of the Vivino community’s favourite Cabernet Sauvignons. One Vivino member even commented, ‘Just wow! An explosion of different flavors’, and another admitted that they were ‘not sure how much better you can get for any price’. With origins in the renowned Caymus Vineyards, the famous winemaking region’s unique heritage can be tasted with each drop. In 1972, Chuck Wagner and his late parents, Lorna and Charlie Sr., opened Caymus Vineyards, starting off with 240 cases of Cabernet Sauvignon. Over half a century later, Caymus Vineyards in Napa Valley remains 100% family-owned and run, and uses many of the same winemaking techniques of generations before. If you’re looking for a specific year to try first, Caymus Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon 2019 vintage is ranked 93 by wine professional, Wilfred Wong. However, Caymus Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon 2020 and 2018 vintages are both in high demand across the U.S. and beyond. Pair any of these vintages with beef, lamb, game, poultry or a cheese board for a dinner party match made in heaven. Bon appétit!",
